![Recursive optimization scheme](/images/generationtrees.png){: .align-right width="400px"}
I am interested in designing efficient and exact algorithms for solving intractable combinatorial optimization problems.

My research can be divided into two main parts: ***general theory*** and **focal theory**.

The general theory focuses on the principles of algorithm design, we employ a formal formalism, known as **transformational programming**,  to design reliable and efficient algorithms. We show that classical combinatorial optimization methods, such as dynamic programming, greedy, branch-and-bound, and divide-and-conquer can all be characterised in the same framework and derived from brute-force algorithms.

The focus theory is centered on developing practical algorithms for solving machine learning problems, particularly those involving finite points and hyperplanes. For example, we have designed exact algorithms to solve classification problems, K-clustering, decision tree optimization, and empirical risk minimization (ERM) for ReLU neural networks. All the algorithms developed within our framework are polynomial-time in the worst case and embarrassingly parallelizable.

# Experience

## Education

- Dec. 2021- present:  I am a third-year PhD student from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/computer-science/index.aspx), [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx), supervised by Dr. [Max. Little](http://www.maxlittle.net/home/index.php). 
- Sept. 2017- June 2021: *Bachelor of Science* at [Zhejiang Normal University](https://www.zjnu.edu.cn/main.htm).  Where I majored in Mechanical Design Manufacturing and Automation.

## Profile

My name is Xi He,  which is the Chinese transcription of "何希",  "Xi" pronounce as "She", it means "hope" in Chinese.

I enjoy lifting weights, basketball and hiking in my free time. I also write some [blogs](https://xihegrt.github.io/year-archive/) sometimes.
