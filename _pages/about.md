![Recursive optimization scheme](/images/generationtrees.png){: .align-right width="400px"}

I’m fascinated by tools and programs you can actually prove things about—no hand-wavy “it works on my machine” stuff. My research focus  is somewhere between algorithm design, combinatorial optimization, and functional programming.

During my PhD, I explored how formal methods from programming-language theory — especially the [Bird–Meertens formalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird%E2%80%93Meertens_formalism) (also known as transformational programming) — can be used to tackle intractable combinatorial optimization problems. Much of my earlier work focused on classical machine-learning tasks, including clustering, classification, and decision-tree learning.

I am currently a Postdoctoral researcher in [Zhenjiang Hu](https://zhenjiang888.github.io/)’s research group at Peking University. Our team is developing a new programming language, referred to as [C*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02246), that aims to unify programming and formal verification for C, enabling developers to write high-assurance systems without separating the acts of coding and proving correctness.

## Profile

My name is Xi He,  which is the Chinese transcription of "何希",  "Xi" pronounce as "She", it means "hope" in Chinese.

I enjoy lifting weights, basketball and hiking in my free time. I also write some [blogs](https://xihegrt.github.io/year-archive/) sometimes.
