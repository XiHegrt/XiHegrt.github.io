![Recursive optimization scheme](/images/generationtrees.png){: .align-right width="300px"}

 I specialize in the development of efficient and exact algorithms aimed at addressing challenging combinatorial intractable problems, many of which fall under the category of NP-complete/NP-hard problems. My approach involves employing a formal methodology that combines a diverse range of applied mathematics disciplines, including **category theory**, **the algebra of programming** (or **the Bird-Meertens Formalism**), **real algebraic geometry**, and **combinatorial generation**.

A pivotal contribution to my work is the establishment of a comprehensive framework called the "**recursive optimization scheme**." This innovative approach amalgamates methodologies from the aforementioned theories, providing a versatile solution for solving intricate combinatorial optimization problems. Currently, my focus extends to the application of this framework in machine learning research.

In a recent endeavor, I applied the recursive optimization scheme to address the well-known 0-1 loss linear classification problem. This classic problem, dating back almost a century to Ronald Fisher's pioneering work in 1936, has persisted as a challenge in the field. A breakthrough, nearly 30 years after the support vector machine was invented by Vapnik et al.

The application of the recursive optimization scheme represents a promising avenue for designing machine learning methodologies, it is a completely new way of designing reliable and tractable machine learning algorithms that are sound and concise.

# Experience

## Education

- Dec. 2021- present:  I am a third-year PhD student from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/computer-science/index.aspx), [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx), supervised by Dr. [Max. Little](http://www.maxlittle.net/home/index.php). 
- Sept. 2017- June 2021: *Bachelor of Science* at [Zhejiang Normal University](https://www.zjnu.edu.cn/main.htm).  Where I majored in Mechanical Design Manufacturing and Automation.

## Research

- [An efficient, provably exact, practical algorithm for the 0-1 loss linear classification problem](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.12344.pdf) **Xi He**, Waheed Ul Rahman, Max A. Little (Under review)
- [Dynamic programming by polymorphic algebraic shortcut fusion] Max A. Little, Xi He, Ugur Kayas (Under review)
  -
  These three papers are talking about the same story, that is, a recursive optimization algorithm (or dynamic programming) can be constructed, accelerated and reconstructed through the identification of monotonicity (distributivity in the function case).

## Software

You can find the Python implementations of my algorithms from my [Git repositories](https://github.com/XiHegrt).

## Activities

- 2-6 April, 2023 Attending [Midlands Graduate School 2023 (bham.ac.uk)](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/events/MGS23/), Birmingham, UK 
- 13 June, 2023 Attending [Advances in Data Science and AI Conference 2023 (manchester.ac.uk)](https://events.manchester.ac.uk/event/event:k14l-leplq84p-od61dv/idsai-advances-in-data-science-and-ai-conference-2023), Manchester

## Profile

My name is Xi He,  which is the Chinese transcription of "何希",  "Xi" pronounce as "She", it means "hope" in Chinese.

I enjoy lifting weights, basketball and hiking in my free time. I also write some blogs about my research or some of my understanding of existing knowledge...
